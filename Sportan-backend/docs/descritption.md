# **SPORTAN — Project Description (Non-Technical)**

## **1. Main Goal**

Sportan is a youth athletic development platform designed to help **coaches**, **young athletes**, and **parents** track training progress, stay organized, and identify athletic potential early.

The primary goal is to create a **simple but powerful ecosystem** where:

* **Coaches** can manage groups, assign workouts, monitor progress, verify training completion, and run talent-identification AI.
* **Athletes** can view their assigned schedules, see their workout history, and track their development data.
* **Parents** can stay informed about their child’s training, performance, and coach-assigned tasks.

Sportan focuses on **clarity, structure, and long-term development**, not performance pressure. Its purpose is to help children grow, support coaches’ workflow, and give parents transparency — all while offering an ethical, responsible approach to early-stage talent recognition.

## **2. Core Objectives**

1. **Organize coaching workflow**
   Provide coaches with a clean interface to manage multiple groups, athletes, parents, and training plans.

2. **Track and measure progress**
   Give athletes and parents visibility into workouts, assignments, and improvements over time.

3. **Support better training decisions**
   Generate clear summaries and statistics for each athlete based on real activity (workouts, assessments).

4. **Offer early talent discovery**
   Provide AI-powered insights to help coaches identify potential strengths in young athletes — without labelling or pressuring kids.

5. **Enable clear communication between coach and parents**
   Parents see exactly what the athlete is asked to do and how they are progressing, promoting safety and accountability.

## **3. Key Features**

### **3.1 Coach Features**

* Create and manage **multiple training groups** (teams/squads/classes).
* Add athletes directly into groups — **no floating athletes**.
* Move athletes between groups or add them to multiple groups.
* Create and manage **assigned workouts**, either:

  * for an entire group, or
  * for a single athlete.
* View athlete summaries (non-AI):

  * workouts this week/month
  * total training volume
  * number of assessments
  * recent activities
* View all assigned workouts and their statuses:

  * pending
  * completed
  * skipped
* **Log workouts** for any athlete (this is how data enters the system).
* **Mark assigned workouts as completed** (verifying the athlete did the work).
* Create, update, and delete parent accounts.
* Run AI analyses:

  * **Talent recognition** (athlete’s potential strengths)
  * **Weekly AI insights** (how well the athlete is training)

### **3.2 Athlete Features**

* View personal profile.
* **View assigned workouts** (pending, completed, skipped).
* View workout history (logged by the coach).
* Belong to one or multiple groups managed by their coach.
* *Note: Athletes are viewers of their data; they do not manually log or complete workouts in the system.*

### **3.3 Parent Features**

* View their own profile + linked child.
* See their child’s athlete profile.
* View child’s non-AI summary (clear, simple stats).
* See all child workouts (logged by coach).
* See assigned workouts and their statuses.
* View AI reports for their child (latest):

  * talent recognition
  * weekly training insights

## **4. Assigned Workouts Logic**

Assigned workouts exist to help coaches plan structured sessions.

* Coaches assign workouts to:

  * all athletes in a group, or
  * one athlete individually.
* Athlete sees these as **pending** tasks.
* **Coach** marks the workout as **completed** (either by logging a specific workout against the assignment or manually updating the status).
* If the calendar day after the scheduled date passes and it was not marked completed:

  * the system automatically marks it as **skipped**.
* Athletes cannot change these statuses.

---

## **5. Data Safety & Ethics**

* Parents do not self-register; all access is granted by the coach.
* Each parent is linked to exactly one child for v1 (clear, controlled access).
* Athletes never see AI talent reports unless explicitly added in future versions.
* AI insights are recommendations — **not labels**.
* All athlete actions and responsibilities are age-appropriate and supervised by the coach.

---

## **6. Why This System Works**

Sportan eliminates chaos in youth training:

* Coaches avoid scattered spreadsheets, WhatsApp messages, and manual tracking.
* Parents get transparency into their child’s sport journey.
* Athletes learn discipline through structured assignments and clear feedback.
* AI adds an extra layer of smart guidance (talent hints, training quality insights).

It’s simple for beginners but powerful enough to scale to full academies, schools, or clubs.
